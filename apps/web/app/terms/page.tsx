      <section id="service">
        <h2>3. What Orientim is, and what it is not</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Non-custodial software.</strong> Orientim builds a Solana swap transaction, checks it against published rules
          and, only after your wallet has signed it, adds the signature of a one-time key and sends it to the Solana network.
          Swaps are executed by the Solana network and by third-party programs and markets, including those routed through
          Jupiter, which we do not own, operate or control.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>We never hold your assets or keys.</strong> At no time do we take custody or control of your digital assets,
          private keys or seed phrase. Every transaction executes only if your wallet signs it. We cannot reverse, cancel or
          freeze a transaction, or recover assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>We are not an exchange, broker, dealer, custodian, money transmitter, adviser or fiduciary.</strong> We do not
          set prices, match orders or trade for you. Nothing on the Services is investment, financial, legal or tax advice, or a
          recommendation. No fiduciary relationship exists between you and us, and to the extent the law allows, any such duty is
          excluded.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your decision.</strong> You alone decide whether to swap, which assets, how much, and on what terms, including
          the minimum you accept and your slippage tolerance, and you review every transaction in your wallet before you sign it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="protection">
        <h2>4. The protection, and its limits</h2>
        <p>
          The Services are designed so that, in a transaction they prepare, the swap programs can reach only the amount you
          approve, through a one-time key, and the transaction reverts if less than the minimum you accepted would arrive. How
          this works, and what it does not cover, is described on <a href="/security">Security</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            This protection is a technical measure, not a guarantee, insurance or promise of any outcome. Software can contain
            errors, and the rules, the Software or their implementation may not work as intended in every case. We do not
            guarantee that any transaction will be protected, will execute, or will execute at any price, or that you will not
            suffer a loss.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          It does not cover, among other things: the price, value or legitimacy of any asset; what a token&apos;s issuer does; a
          compromised wallet, key, seed phrase or device; a copy of the website anywhere but orientim.com; and a transaction the
          Services did not prepare, or that you or your wallet changed.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="responsibilities">
        <h2>5. Your responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You are responsible for the security of your wallet, keys, seed phrase, devices, API keys, and any agent, bot or signing service you use.</li>
          <li>You open Orientim only at orientim.com, and read what your wallet shows before you sign.</li>
          <li>
            Where you use the API or the Software, you run the check the Software provides, on your own RPC, before you sign. If you
            skip or change it, you rely on the transaction as our servers prepared it, at your own risk.
          </li>
          <li>You are responsible for your taxes and for complying with the laws that apply to you.</li>
          <li>The assets you use are lawfully yours, or you are authorised to use them, and do not come from unlawful activity.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="fees">
        <h2>6. Fees</h2>
        <p>
          Orientim charges a fee of {TREASURY ? feeText : 'the percentage shown before you sign'} of the swap, included in and
          collected through the transaction you sign. The fee, the network fee and any charge of a market or token are shown before
          you sign; see <a href="/security#fees">fees</a>. We may change the fee for future transactions; the fee that applies is
          the one in the transaction you sign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fees are collected on chain when the transaction executes and are <strong>non-refundable</strong>. A transaction that does
          not execute may still cost its network fee, which is paid to the Solana network, not to us.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="third-parties">
        <h2>7. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
          The Services depend on third parties, including the Solana network, Jupiter and the markets it routes through, token
          issuers, RPC and hosting providers, and wallets. We do not control them and are not responsible for their availability,
          security or conduct, or for any loss they cause. Their own terms may apply to you.

        <h2>8. What you may not do</h2>
        <p>You will not, and will not let anyone, including your agent or bot:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>use the Services in breach of any law or Sanctions, or to finance, launder or hide the proceeds of unlawful activity;</li>
          <li>use the Services for a person described in section 2;</li>
          <li>attack, overload, probe or disrupt the Services or their users, or get around a rate limit, fee or security measure;</li>
          <li>copy, mirror, frame or impersonate the Services or Orientim, or run anything that could be confused with Orientim;</li>
          <li>use the Services to manipulate a market, including wash trading or spoofing; or</li>
          <li>resell or offer the API or the Services to others as your own service without our written permission.</li>

        <h2>9. Developers, agents and bots</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>An API key is bound to the wallet that signed for it, works for that wallet only, and expires after 90 days. You are responsible for every use of your keys.</li>
          <li>We may set and change rate limits, and suspend, revoke or refuse any key at any time, with or without notice.</li>
          <li>The API has no uptime, support or service-level commitment, and we may change or discontinue any part of it.</li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for your agent or bot: its instructions and limits, how it keeps keys and records, what it signs, and
            every transaction it makes. We are not responsible for any decision, error or loss of an agent, a bot or an AI model.

            To the fullest extent the law allows, Orientim, its affiliates and their directors, officers, employees and contractors
            (the Orientim Parties) are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or for
            any loss of profits, revenue, opportunity, data, or digital assets or their value,

        <p>
          This includes, to the fullest extent the law allows, any loss caused by: an error, bug, vulnerability or failure of the
          Services or the Software, including the transaction builder, the verifier and its rules; a third-party service; market
          movements, price or slippage; a transaction you or your agent signed; unauthorised access to your wallet, device or keys;

        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that the law does not allow to be excluded or limited, such as for
          fraud, or rights you have as a consumer under the mandatory law of your country of residence. There, our liability is
          limited to the smallest extent the law permits. These limits are an essential part of the agreement and are reflected in

          your agent or bot, your breach of these Terms, of any law or of Sanctions, or any transaction you or your agent signed.

          individually, not in any class or representative proceeding, and any claim must be brought within one year after it
          arose. If you are a consumer, nothing in this section takes away a right the mandatory law of your country of residence
